# Lightning Wallet

A web based bitcoin lightning wallet built upon LNbits.

## Warning!

This is not running on a testnet!

This is a working custodial bitcoin lightning wallet made as a proof of concept.

This can be used as a temporary hot wallet or for testing.

All wallet information is generated and stored locally on your device.

If that information is removed you will lose wallet functionality and lose funds.

It is recommended you back up your wallet once it is generated before usage so you can restore it if need be.

By clicking `Generate New Wallet` you accept full responsibility for usage and any funds send to and from this wallet.

## Using the wallet

If you want to test the wallet but don't have any bitcoin you can use this faucet `https://www.lightningnetworkstores.com/faucet` send a small amount of satoshi's (smaller units of bitcoin) over to the wallet you generate. Simply paste the lnurl into the input field on the receive tab.
